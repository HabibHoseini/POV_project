Welcome to the Persistence of Vision project repository! This project aims to explore the fascinating concept of persistence of vision through practical applications and experimentation.

Persistence of vision refers to the phenomenon where the human eye retains an image for a brief moment after its source has been removed. Leveraging this phenomenon, our project delves into creating captivating visual effects and displays using simple hardware components and innovative software techniques.
